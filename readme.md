# Introduction

Urban areas face growing challenges with traffic congestion, accidents, and delays in public transport. These issues reduce efficiency, increase pollution, and frustrate commuters.  

To address this, the city of **Ringsted** has deployed a network of IoT sensors that continuously collect data on vehicle movements and traffic flow.  

This project proposes a **big data solution** that will:
- Collect and process real-time traffic data  
- Present insights to city planners for immediate decision-making  
- Store selected data for long-term analysis  

By leveraging data-driven insights, the project aims to optimize traffic flow, improve safety, and enhance public transportation efficiency.
